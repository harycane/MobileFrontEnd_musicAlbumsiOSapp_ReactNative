# Albums
Developed an iOS mobile app using react native that fetches list of music albums from an API's HTTP endpoint. Updated the state to re-render a scrollable view of music album's title, artist, thumbnail and cover images, and a buy now linking to amazon page, styled using Flexbox. Designed components to be reusable by passing data and components from the parent to child, using props and props children.
